# We're evolving...

We started Online Shop with one goal in mind; to make e-commerce easier. To build an entry point... a platform that was easily accessible to all, no matter how tech savvy you are. 

Our goal was always to make everything easier, and simpler; whether it’s setting up your shop, attracting new customers or re-engaging existing ones to recapture interest and achieve highest returns on your investment of time with us as a marketplace. 

This goal of oversimplifying everything provided us with the opportunity to help countless brands, local businesses, entrepreneurs, students and hobbyists achieve unprecedented online presence through tools and security practices not found anywhere else; we made strides in simplification of even the most mundane, such as product upload and catalogue management to payment processing and managing customer data in the most secure way possible – too many to mention.

We built a powerful engine that enabled anyone to easily launch, manage and process payments and customer data without hassle, in the simplest and most secure way possible. We made scaling your business as easy as as opening your shop... However, we found ourselves receiving requests and questions from our users on how to garner more traffic to increase their organic presence across search engines such as Google and Bing. We answered by developing more and more features that provided automations that focused on optimisations and security compliance.

This constant development and investment into our users led us to create a more tools that were purely seller centric, slowly we became more focused on driving traffic for our sellers, and began building out a community that encompassed developers, entrepreneurs, businesses and so on. We started adding features that were more akin to a marketplace, and soon we became just that. We offered a lot of features and functionality others didn’t, and we were able to become one of Britain’s top marketplaces for a while. We opened a 20,500 sq. feet warehouse in Harrogate and started working with bigger and bigger brands to help them sell more online. After all, e-commerce is our expertise and forte.

We started noticing that our focus on users and the ability to drive organic traffic to their shops had some disadvantages – our good will and intentions started being abused by bigger sellers, who had the power to lower their prices and outprice their competition - which were usually a lot smaller. This wasn’t what we intended at all. It became a colosseum, taking us back to the old Roman Empire, automatically pitting sellers against one another through sheer influx of bigger sellers – and this is something we never wanted, or intended. We saw bigger and bigger brands take more and more sales from our smaller, independent sellers. We’re big believers in an open, and a free market and putting a stop to sellers’ activity, based on their size and market share, would go against it.

Thus, we made the difficult decision to shut down our marketplace and focus on our original goal; to make e-commerce easier. Over the last year we learned a lot, we grew and we provided the tools for some amazing success stories. Now it’s time to take the learnings from our marketplace, and implement them into our original core product.

We’re providing some amazing new features that will be accessible to all, from Web3 support to messenger integrations such as WhatsApp to make shopping that more accessible and social. 

**We're building the future of e-commerce...**

One of our main objectives is to build an open community – an open forum for businesses, developers, entrepreneurs, students, hobbyists and even brands; to achieve more, to sell more and to learn more. 

Co-operation is the key to everyone’s success, and isn’t it more fun that way?

Pricing is also changing; our pricing is now reflective of our operational cost and not profit margin. Most of our core features will be available to all, regardless of which subscription plan you’re on, from ‘Free’ to our most advanced ‘Professional’ plan. We want everyone to be included and to receive the same level of opportunity and value.

We’re also aiming to open up some of our technology for community development under ‘Shop.js’ moniker, enabling developers to contribute to our ever-expanding repository, and to develop some amazing new features that our core team might not have the time to focus on right away but are in great demand by our community – and there’s so much more we can’t really write about now, but will announce quite soon.

In addition, we’re opening up our communication channels, where staff and users are able to discuss, exchange ideas and find solutions in a transparent way. 

All in all, we’re very happy with our decision to help build and innovate the next generation of e-commerce, providing Web3 access and so much more to everyone... regardless of age, gender,  or technical savvy. 

We'll be back very soon, and our new launch is just in the next few months! 

Thank you all for your continued support - and be patient, something amazing is coming and we want you to be part of this pivotal moment in our history.
